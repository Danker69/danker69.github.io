<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I attended Medina Jr-Sr High School and participated in track (I ran every sprint) and cross country. I like working on video games, running (no surprise), gaming, and working out. I little fun fact about me is that I drive an old cop car.</p>

<p>I don't really have one favorite food, but I REALLY like tacos.</p>
